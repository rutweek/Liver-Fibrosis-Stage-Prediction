# Liver-Fibrosis-Stage-Prediction
Liver fibrosis occurs when the healthy tissue of your liver becomes scarred and therefore cannot work as well. Fibrosis is the first stage of liver scarring. Later, if more of the liver becomes scarred, it’s known as liver cirrhosis.

## What are the stages of liver fibrosis?
There are several different scales of liver fibrosis staging, where a doctor determines the degree of liver damage. Since staging can be subjective, each scale has its own limitations. One doctor may think a liver is slightly more scarred than another. However, doctors will usually assign a stage to liver fibrosis because it helps the patient and other doctors understand the degree to which a person’s liver is affected.

## There are 4 stages of Liver Fibrosis

* Portal fibrosis without septa
* Portal fibrosis with few septa
* Numerous septa without cirrhosis
* Cirrhosis
